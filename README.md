## What Is GTA: Frosted Winter: Remastered?

This project is a recreation of the original GTA Frosted Winter project from 2010. 
It's the same mod on the surface, but rewritten from scratch to include hundreds of bug fixes and quality of life improvements. 

We have aimed to not only preserve the original project, but also give players the definitive Frosted Winter experience. Check the changelog below to see exactly what we've changed :)

## Installation

You'll need your own 1.0 copy of the game in order to play the mod, we cannot provide this for you. Fortunately downgrading to 1.0 is as easy as [downloading a 1.0 exe](https://www.google.com/) and placing it inside your game Steam/RGL folder. Once you've done that or you already have a 1.0 copy, copy our files on top from the [releases](https://github.com/EnglishBen/GTAFrostedWinterRemastered-Public/releases) section and you're good to go!

## Found An Issue?

Please [create an issue on Github](https://github.com/EnglishBen/GTAFrostedWinterRemastered-Public/issues). Before doing so, please make sure you've read the FAQ section below and answer all the questions we ask on the issues page. Any issue created that doesn't follow these steps will be closed.

## Frequently Asked Questions

- **I'm trying to run the game and it won't launch while using a resolution that isn't 16:9 and 1080p**

If you're playing at a non-standard 1080p resolution, please make sure to update widescreenfix.ini as appropiate, It's inside the Scripts folder. Some people have reported that forcing the game to run in 1080p first will allow the game to launch, and then you can try to adjust the resolution in-game once you're in.

- **I'm trying to stream/record the game but it's laggy**

The game looks fullscreen, but is actually borderless by default. This means that using game capture will kill the FPS, so use window capture instead.

- **Loading the autosave sometimes crashes my game**

We are investigating this issue, but it seems totally random which makes it hard to nail down. Fortunately your save will work once you reboot the game, so just load it and continue as normal. :)

- **Will there be custom radio?**

Sadly not, the audio included will be the vanilla audio. We cannot distribute DMCA songs without a huge risk of a takedown, but if you still have your own copy of the original mod's radio that will work just fine.

- **Can I change the snow physics?**

Yes! If you want the original snow physics back, simply take the surface.dat we've included and copy it into your Data folder.

- **Can I mute the voiceover?**

Of course, simply press numpad plus/minus to change the voiceover volume. To mute, just set it to 0%.

- **When I load my save, a really annoying sound plays**

This is a vanilla bug that seems to happen more frequently in Frosted Winter. Simply pausing and unpausing should fix it!

- **When I try and boot the game, it just sits idle in task manager instead**

This vanilla bug is solved by heading to gta3.exe -> right click -> properties -> compatibility -> change DPI settings -> tick "high DPI scaling override".

- **The game boots, but I cannot move my mouse in-game**

The game might have set your in-game sensitivity to zero, just head to mouse settings in-game and change it.

- **Does this project use AI?**

Being fully transparent, this project uses AI twice. The first being the credits song (it's sadly not viable for us to pay someone to or create our own music from scratch), and the second being a very small part of the voiceover. Joey/Luigi/Toni/Mickey are AI generated, but everyone else (around 95% of the total cast) are all voiced by members of the community as you can see in the Credits section. We have made every effort to make the best mod we can with as much human involvement as possible.
